# Image Background Remover

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for removing the background from images using the `rembg` library. The GUI is built with `tkinter` and features a dark theme courtesy of `sv_ttk`. This tool is particularly useful for photographers, graphic designers, and anyone who needs to isolate subjects in images for further processing.

## Introduction
Removing backgrounds from images can be a tedious task, especially when done manually. This application automates the process using the `rembg` library, which leverages machine learning to accurately and efficiently remove backgrounds. The user-friendly GUI allows users to easily select input images and save the processed output without needing to write any code.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive GUI for selecting and processing images.
- Automatic background removal using `rembg`.
- Dark theme for a modern look and feel.
- Preview of both input and output images within the application.
